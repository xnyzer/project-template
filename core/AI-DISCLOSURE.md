# AI Disclosure

This project is developed using **Claude Code** (by Anthropic) as the primary development
tool. In the interest of transparency, this document describes how AI is involved in the
development process.

## Roles

**Human (Project Owner):** Defines requirements, makes architectural and security
decisions, manages the project, tests functionality, and ensures the end result meets
expectations. Does not write or review code at a technical level.

**AI (Claude Code):** Writes all code, proposes technical solutions, implements features,
and maintains documentation. Operates under the direction and approval of the project
owner.

## How AI is used

- **All code** in this project is written by Claude Code
- **Architecture and technical decisions** are proposed by the AI and confirmed or
  adjusted by the project owner
- **Planning and documentation** are created collaboratively
- **Testing** is performed by the AI (automated tests) and the project owner
  (functional/user perspective)

## Transparency

- Every commit includes a `Co-Authored-By: Claude` tag
- The project owner steers direction, priorities, and acceptance criteria
- The AI does not deploy, publish, or make irreversible changes without explicit approval

## Why this matters for a security tool

{{PROJECT_NAME}} is security-relevant software. AI-written code does not exempt it from
scrutiny: it is built on vetted libraries (no hand-rolled crypto), the design is
fail-closed, and a mandatory human-approved security review precedes any public exposure.
The quality of the result depends on both sides: precise requirements and competent
execution, plus deliberate review of the security-critical paths.
